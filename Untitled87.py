# Q1. Is it permissible to use several import statements to import the same module? What would the goal be? Can you think of a situation where it would be beneficial?
#     

# Yes, it is allowed to import the same module multiple times. This can be beneficial when you want to access specific parts of the module without importing the entire module. It helps with organizing code and avoiding naming conflicts.

# Q2. What are some of a module's characteristics? (Name at least one.)
# 

# One characteristic of a module is that it allows you to encapsulate related code into a single unit, making your code more organized and modular.

# Q3. Circular importing, such as when two modules import each other, can lead to dependencies and bugs that aren't visible. How can you go about creating a program that avoids mutual importing?
# 

# Refactor code to reduce interdependencies.
# Use dependency injection instead of direct imports.
# Restructure code by creating an intermediary module.
# Split modules into smaller, focused modules.
# Utilize import guards or conditional imports.

# Q4. Why is  _ _all_ _ in Python?
# 

#  imported when using the from module import * syntax. It allows module authors to control the module's public interface and prevent cluttering of the global namespace.

# Q5. In what situation is it useful to refer to the _ _name_ _ attribute or the string '_ _main_ _'?
# 

# Using __name__ or __main__ is useful when you want to execute code only when a module is run directly as a script, not when it is imported.

# Q6. What are some of the benefits of attaching a program counter to the RPN interpreter application, which interprets an RPN script line by line?
# 

# Ensuring sequential execution.
# Facilitating error handling and reporting.
# Allowing control flow constructs (loops, conditionals).
# Simplifying debugging and profiling.
# Enabling interactivity with the interpreter.

# Q7. What are the minimum expressions or statements (or both) that you'd need to render a basic programming language like RPN primitive but completeâ€” that is, capable of carrying out any computerised task theoretically possible?
# 

# Numeric values and arithmetic operations.
# Conditional statements for decision-making.
# Loops for repetition.
# Stack manipulation for RPN computations.
# Variable assignment and storage.
# Input/output functionality.
# With these features, the RPN language can handle various calculations, make decisions, repeat actions, store and retrieve data, and interact with users or external systems.
